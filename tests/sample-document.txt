Timeline: Google shutters Chinese site, moves to Hong Kong

Following are some key developments in Google's bumpy foray into China: 

2000 - Google develops Chinese-language interface for its Google.com website.

2002 - Google.com becomes temporarily unavailable to Chinese users, with interference from domestic competition suspected.

July 2005 - Google hires ex-Microsoft executive Lee Kai Fu as head of Google China. Microsoft sues Google over the move, claiming Lee will inevitably disclose propriety information to Google. The two rivals reach a settlement on the suit over Lee in December.

Jan 2006 - Google rolls out Google.cn, its China-based search page that, in accordance with Chinese rules, censors search results. Google says it made the trade-off to "make meaningful and positive contributions" to development in China while abiding by the country's strict censorship laws.
